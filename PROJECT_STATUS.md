# 📊 PlayCricket Platform - Project Status

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Current Phase**: Backend Development - TDD Model Implementation  
**Overall Progress**: 15% Complete

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Building a comprehensive cricket platform matching ESPNcricinfo's feature set with:
- **Live ball-by-ball scoring** with real-time updates
- **Comprehensive statistics** (player, team, tournament)
- **Advanced visualizations** (Manhattan chart, Wagon Wheel, Worm chart)
- **Tournament management** with automatic standings calculation
- **DRS integration** and commentary system
- **High performance**: <50ms API response, 1000+ req/s throughput

---

## 📈 Progress by Phase

### ✅ Phase 1: Schema Design & Planning (100% Complete)

**Duration**: Week 0  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

#### Deliverables Completed:
- ✅ Complete PostgreSQL database schema (48+ tables/views)
- ✅ 6 SQL migration files:
  - `001_core_schema.sql` - 19 core tables
  - `002_enum_seeds.sql` - Reference data population
  - `003_stats_views.sql` - 8 analytics views
  - `004_tournament_views.sql` - League tables, NRR calculation
  - `005_advanced_features.sql` - DRS, commentary, live features
  - `006_test_data_seeds.sql` - 2-over demo match
- ✅ API DTO definitions (Python Pydantic models)
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for Angular
- ✅ Complete development roadmap (10-week plan)

**Key Decisions**:
- PostgreSQL 15+ for robust relational features
- ULID for public IDs (better than UUID for sorting)
- Non-destructive delivery corrections (replaces_delivery_id)
- Materialized views for complex analytics
- pg_trgm extension for fuzzy search
