# 🎯 Development Session Summary - December 2024

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. Documentation Updates ✅
- Updated all references from `angular/` to `frontend/` folder
- Updated README.md with getting started links
- Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md with frontend references
- Created comprehensive guides (NEXT_STEPS.md, TDD_WORKFLOW.md, etc.)

### 2. Backend Infrastructure ✅
- **Created Team Model** (`app/models/team.py`)
  - ULID-based public IDs
  - Unique constraints on name and short_name
  - Optional color fields and logo
  - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
  - to_dict() method for API serialization
  - __repr__() for debugging

- **Created Base Model** (`app/models/base.py`)
  - SQLAlchemy DeclarativeBase
  - Auto-incrementing integer primary key

- **Updated app/models/__init__.py**
  - Exports Base and Team models

### 3. Fixed Import Issues ✅
- Updated `app/core/database.py` to not export Base (comes from models)
- Updated `app/main.py` to import Base from models
- Updated `tests/conftest.py` to import Base from models
- Fixed GZipMiddleware import name

## 🚀 Next Steps to Continue Development

### IMMEDIATE: Start Docker Services

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL and Redis
cd /Users/shahjahanrasel/Development/playcricket/backend
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Verify services are running
docker-compose ps

# Expected output:
# playcricket-postgres   running   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
# playcricket-redis      running   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp
```

### STEP 1: Verify Team Model Tests Pass

```bash
# Run tests (should pass once Docker is up)
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/models/test_team.py -v

# Expected: 10 tests should PASS ✅
```

### STEP 2: Setup Alembic Migrations

```bash
# Initialize Alembic
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
alembic init alembic

# Edit alembic/env.py to configure it
# (See configuration below)

# Create first migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add team model"

# Apply migration
alembic upgrade head
```

**Alembic env.py configuration:**

```python
# In alembic/env.py, update these sections:

# Add at top after imports:
from app.core.config import settings
from app.models.base import Base
from app.models import Team  # Import all models

# Update target_metadata:
target_metadata = Base.metadata

# Update sqlalchemy.url in config.set_main_option:
config.set_main_option("sqlalchemy.url", settings.DATABASE_URL)
```

### STEP 3: Continue with Player Model (TDD)

```bash
# 1. Create test file
touch tests/models/test_player.py

# 2. Write tests FIRST (RED phase)
# - test_create_player
# - test_player_team_relationship
# - test_player_batting_style
# - test_player_bowling_style

# 3. Run tests (should FAIL)
pytest tests/models/test_player.py -v

# 4. Implement Player model (GREEN phase)
# Create app/models/player.py

# 5. Run tests again (should PASS)
pytest tests/models/test_player.py -v
```

## 📋 Models Implementation Order

Follow this order for TDD implementation:

1. ✅ **Team** - COMPLETED
2. ⏳ **Player** - NEXT (has FK to Team)
3. ⏳ **Venue** - Independent model
4. ⏳ **Official** - Independent model
5. ⏳ **Tournament** - Independent model
6. ⏳ **Match** - Complex (FK to Team, Venue, Tournament)
7. ⏳ **Innings** - Complex (FK to Match, Team)
8. ⏳ **Delivery** - MOST CRITICAL (ball-by-ball tracking)

---

## 🧪 Testing Workflow (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

For EACH model:

```bash
# 1. RED: Write failing test
vim tests/models/test_[model].py
pytest tests/models/test_[model].py -v  # ❌ FAILS

# 2. GREEN: Implement model
vim app/models/[model].py
pytest tests/models/test_[model].py -v  # ✅ PASSES

# 3. REFACTOR: Clean up code
black app tests
mypy app/models/[model].py
pytest tests/models/test_[model].py -v  # ✅ STILL PASSES

# 4. MIGRATE: Create database migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add [model] model"
alembic upgrade head

# 5. COMMIT: Save progress
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement [Model] model with tests"
```

## 🐳 Docker Services

### Start Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Check Status
```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f postgres
```

### Database Connection
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
docker exec -it playcricket-postgres psql -U cricket -d cricketdb

# Verify tables (after Alembic migration)
\dt

# Expected tables:
# - teams
# - alembic_version
```

### Stop Services
```bash
docker-compose down        # Stop
docker-compose down -v     # Stop and remove data
```

## 🔍 Current Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Tests Require Docker ✅
**Solution**: Start Docker services with `docker-compose up -d`

### Issue 2: Python 3.13 Compatibility ✅
**Solution**: Updated all packages to latest versions compatible with Python 3.13

### Issue 3: Greenlet Missing ✅
**Solution**: Installed greenlet (required by async SQLAlchemy)

### Issue 4: PostgreSQL Port Conflict ⚠️
**If you get "port 5432 already in use":**
```bash
# Stop existing PostgreSQL
brew services stop postgresql@15

# Or change port in docker-compose.yml
ports:
  - "5433:5432"  # Use 5433 externally

# Update DATABASE_URL in .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://cricket:cricket123@localhost:5433/cricketdb
```

## 📊 Test Coverage Status

**Current**: 62% (because models aren't tested yet - need Docker running)
**Target**: 90%+

Once Docker is running and tests pass:
```bash
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## 🎓 Remember: TDD Process

```
1. Write Test (RED)    → Tests FAIL ❌
2. Implement Code (GREEN) → Tests PASS ✅
3. Refactor Code       → Tests STILL PASS ✅
4. Create Migration    → Database updated
5. Commit Changes      → Progress saved
6. Repeat for next feature
```
